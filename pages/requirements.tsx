					<h2>
						When is CAS Due?
					</h2>

					<blockquote>
						At the end of May, but you should be wrapping things up by the beginning of May.
					</blockquote>

					<h2>
						How many entries should I have?
					</h2>
					<blockquote>
						6 â€“ 10 minimum, more is fine.
					</blockquote>

					<h2>
						How many of each CAS category should I have?
					</h2>
					<blockquote>
						At least 2 of each Creativity, Activity, and Service. Many activities will combine more than 1.
					</blockquote>

					</h2>
					<blockquote>
						All of them at least once, and five of them at least twice.
					</blockquote>

					<h2>

					</h2>
					<blockquote>
						At least 3, one from the beginning middle and end. Label them reflection 1, 2 and 3.

					</h2>

					</blockquote>

					<p>
						I will start reviewing CAS Portfolios for completion around mid-May, but you should have
						everything wrapped up by June 4 th. As there are over 200 students to review, do not expect to
						see your portfolio marked complete by any certain date.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Please refer to previous messages regarding evidence and what to include in your
						reflections.
